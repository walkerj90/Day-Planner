# Day Planner
## A basic Javascript day planner

A JavaScript application that utilizes jQuery to make a simple day planner
This is a basic web-app designed to allow a user to plan their day by saving tasks to a 9-5 schedule for each day.

## Design and Usage Notes
The planner is built assuming a 9-5 workday, and will dynamically be styled based upon the time of day. The current date button will set the date to plan to today. By changing this date in the field (but maintaing the format), other days can be planned individually. The save buttons are all linked, so editing a whole day requires only one save.
